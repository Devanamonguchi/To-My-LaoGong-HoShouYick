Meeting you at the UC Badminton Club was the best thing that ever happened to me. Our journey has been nothing short of amazing, from our long video calls to the strong connection we share. You are my rock and my best friend.

On your special day, I want you to know how much I love and appreciate you. I can't wait to create more beautiful memories together in the future.

With all my love,  
Your BǎoBǎo, Devana
